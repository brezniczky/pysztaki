PySztaki
Translator script for console using the szotar.sztaki.hu database

A really short script, which uses the given dictionary (in first
parameter) to translate a word or an expression. It uses web-based
translator of szotar.sztaki.hu (parsed with BeautifulSoup
http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/). The translate()
function contains the actual translation code, it can be simply
reused.

* Requirements

- Python interpreter, tested with 2.4 and 2.5.
- The script depends on BeautifulSoup python module,
  which can be downloaded from
  http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/

The script uses the ordered dictionary class on this url, but you have
nothing to do with this, it's included in the script.
