Translator script for console using the szotar.sztaki.hu database

A really short script, which uses the given dictionary (in first
parameter) to translate a word or an expression. It uses web-based
translator of szotar.sztaki.hu (parsed with BeautifulSoup
http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/). The translate()
function contains the actual translation code, it can be simply
reused.
